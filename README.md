# Data analysis and Churn prediction for an imaginary telecommunication company. 

## *Introduction*
This project aims to predict customers who are likely to churn for a telecom company using Machine Learning. As it is much more expensive to gain new customers, it is important to identify churners and take proactive retention measures. <br>

In this project you will find, 
- Data preprocessing with encoding, scaling,       
- Data visualization to illustrate correlation with the target,
- Target prediction using different models, and finally
- SHAP visualization to show feature importance.
